/**
  ## Internal RTC Helper Libraries

  The RTC library uses a number of helper modules that are contained within
  the `lib/` folder of the `rtc-io/rtc` repository.  While these are designed
  primarily for internal use, they can be accessed by directly requiring
  the modules, e.g. `require('rtc/lib/helpermodule')`
