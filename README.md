## Implementation Specifics

The rtc.js library is written using the [node.js](http://nodejs.org) module pattern, and can be compiled for the browser using the excellent [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).  While I wasn't originally a fan of the Browserify approach, the V2 implementation (now current) is incredibly well done.  I will be writing a blog post on why browserify is the best option for writing and composing reusable JS libraries soon...
